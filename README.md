# libft
Implementation of several Standard C Library functions

Libft is an individual project at 42 that requires us to re-create some standard C library functions including some additional ones that can be used later to build a library of useful functions for the rest of the program.

We re-create these functions in order to deepen our understanding of C. The general philosophy of 42 is that it's best to fully understand that machine that you're using and how it all works together. As a result, we avoid treating even these basic functions as black-boxes.
