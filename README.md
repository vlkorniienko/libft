# libft
Implementation of several Standard C Library functions

Libft is an individual project at Unit FActory that requires us to re-create some standard C library functions including some additional ones that can be used later to build a library of useful functions for the rest of the program.

We re-create these functions in order to deepen our understanding of C. The general philosophy of Unit Factory is that it's best to fully understand that machine that you're using and how it all works together. As a result, we avoid treating even these basic functions as black-boxes.

Notes:

	All the files and functions are namespaced with an ft_ in front. It stands for Fourty Two(original name of school in France)
	The project instructions require that we put all the source files in the root directory.

The goal is to create a library called libft.a from the source files so I can later use that library from other projects at Unit Factory.
